# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied After Dynamic Content Update

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied correctly after dynamic content updates using JavaScript.  The issue arises when content is added or removed from the DOM, causing Tailwind's styling to not re-apply to the updated elements.

## Bug Description:
The bug occurs when dynamically updating a component's content which involves adding or removing elements.  Tailwind classes do not render correctly on newly added elements, even after a component update cycle. 

## Solution:
The solution involves using a mechanism to force Tailwind to re-apply styles after the DOM update. This can be achieved by forcing a re-render or leveraging Tailwind's purge feature, ensuring the updated elements are included in Tailwind's output.
